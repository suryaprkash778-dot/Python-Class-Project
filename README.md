# 🔐 Password Manager in C  

## 📌 Project Summary  
This project is a **console-based password manager** developed in **C**. It allows users to store, retrieve, search, and delete login credentials locally. It demonstrates key programming concepts such as **file handling**, **dynamic memory management**, and **pointer-based string manipulation**.  

## ✨ Features  
- ➕ Add new credentials (website, username, password)  
- 📂 View all saved credentials  
- 🔍 Search credentials by website or username  
- ❌ Delete credentials  
- 💾 Persistent storage in a text file (`credentials.txt`)  

## 🧠 Concepts Demonstrated  
- **Structures and functions** → Used to define and manipulate credential records  
- **File operations** → `fopen`, `fprintf`, `fscanf`, `remove`, `rename` for persistent storage  
- **Pointer-based string manipulation** → For input parsing and dynamic handling  
- **Dynamic memory management** → Allocating memory for credential arrays and strings  
- **Modular programming using header files** → Organized into reusable components for clarity and scalability
